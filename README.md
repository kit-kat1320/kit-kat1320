I am a MERN stack and JS developer with a passion for creating. 
I have experience with working with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, 
MySQL, Mongo, HTML, CSS, and Git. I am a quick learner and I am always
looking to expand my knowledge and skills set. I left a carrer in legal
compliance, a detail-oriened and fast paced enviroment, to pursue programing, 
which had up to that point only been a hoby. I am excieted to 
work with other developers going forward.
